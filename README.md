# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine.

## Functionality

The WTWR application uses current weather information to filter clothing items. It will display the clothing options that are appropriate for the current weather. The filters are for "hot", "warm", or "cold" weather.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

This back-end project utilized Git, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Compass, Postman, Google Cloud, and PM2. These applications were used to create the database, manage the database, and test the connection between our code and the database. A suite was made on Postman to assist with testing error handling and validation. This project utilizes modules, express, eslint, routes, controllers, and schemas.
